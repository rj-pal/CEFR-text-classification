# CEFR-text-classification

Final Project for Lighthouse Labs Data Science program. This project entails building and comparing models that takes a sample of an English language text and categorizes the level as one of five levels: A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2. These designations are five of the six levels from the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) 6-point industry standard scale for evaluating English proficiency.

This project includes:
  1. Python file scripts customized for this project: cleaning_nlp and preprocessing_nlp
  2. Jupyter Notebooks for cleaning and preparing the data for modelling.
  3. Jupyter Notebooks for modeling.

Two data sets were used in this project:
  1. The Cambridge Readability [Data Set](https://ilexir.co.uk/datasets/index.html).<br>

  2. The One Stop [English Corpus](https://github.com/nishkalavallabhi/OneStopEnglishCorpus)

Both data sets were indispensable to the feasibility and success of this project and were a source of inspiration for creating tools that can help English language learners to prosper.
