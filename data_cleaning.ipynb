    "#### Note: \n",
    "Cleaning of the *Cambridge English Readability Data Set* was an iterative process of manual text examination through python looping. Because the size was manageable, my data cleaning included, for some examples, taking notes of certain words or phrases causing probelms, like list header items, as well as the examining the lengths of title lines to make a cut-off for texts that didn't have titles while not deleting texts that had no title with shorter lengths. I included some of the code testing blocks commented out, to get a sense of the cleaning process. I believe I did a pretty good job of cleaning the documents, though I also note that some list items and other small words that should be deleted were missed and an even more thourough cleaning should be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleted files **FCE/19.txt, FCE/28.txt, FCE/32.txt** as they were duplicates of **FCE/20.txt, FCE/29.txt, FCE/33.txt**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modified **PET/34.txt** due to lack of spacing in two sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "All cleaning functions can be found in the *cleaning_nlp.py* file\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the original files have been untouched and only cleaned after loading and processing through the process_directory function."
